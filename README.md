# 🏨 Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis – AICTE VOIS Internship Project (Oct 2025)

## 📌 Project Overview  
Airbnb has transformed how people travel and stay in metropolitan cities.  
While it offers unique experiences, its rapid growth has also created challenges:  
- Certain neighbourhoods are overcrowded with listings.  
- Pricing fluctuates drastically, creating market imbalance.  
- Guest experiences remain inconsistent.  

This project leverages **Airbnb Open Data** to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and uncover patterns in listings, hosts, reviews, pricing, and availability — providing insights for hosts, guests, and policymakers.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- 🔹 Clean and preprocess raw Airbnb datasets  
- 🔹 Analyse **listings distribution** across neighbourhood groups  
- 🔹 Identify **top-performing hosts** and their dominance  
- 🔹 Compare **reviews, availability, and pricing patterns**  
- 🔹 Build **visualisations**: bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, word clouds  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** – Data cleaning & analysis  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Dataset handling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualisation  
- **WordCloud** – Text-based visualisation  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** – Development environment  
- **GitHub** – Version control & project hosting  

## 📊 Results & Insights  
### 📍 Neighbourhood Distribution  
- Manhattan & Brooklyn dominate Airbnb activity.  
- Staten Island has the least listings.  

### 🏠 Host Insights  
- Few hosts manage hundreds of listings → market concentration.  

### 💬 Reviews  
- Reviews are frequent in central locations.  
- Weak correlation between **reviews & pricing**.  

### 💵 Pricing Trends  
- Majority of listings under **$200/night**.  
- Luxury properties skew data with high outliers.  

### 🛋️ Room Type Analysis  
- **Entire homes/apartments** dominate & are most expensive.  
- **Shared rooms** are rare and cheapest.  

### 📅 Availability  
- Many listings either **365 days available** or **completely unavailable**.  

###  Correlation Heatmap  
- Strong link between **reviews per month** & **total reviews**.  
- Price has weak correlations with other features.  

### ☁️ Word Cloud of Listing Names  
Frequent terms: *“Cozy”, “Private”, “Apartment”* — common marketing buzzwords.  

## 📷 Visual Outputs  
- Neighbourhood distribution charts  
- Host dominance visualisation  
- Pricing & availability scatter plots  
- Heatmaps & correlation matrices  
- Word Cloud of listing descriptions  
*(See Jupyter Notebook for detailed plots)*  

## 🚀 Conclusion  
This analysis provides a **data-driven overview of Airbnb’s urban market**.  
Key takeaways:  
- Market saturation in some areas  
- Few dominant hosts control large shares  
- Guest engagement varies by property type & location  

### Impact:  
- 🏠 **Hosts** → Optimise pricing & availability  
- 🌍 **Airbnb** → Manage overcrowding & improve user experience  
- 📊 **Researchers/Policymakers** → Better regulatory insights
